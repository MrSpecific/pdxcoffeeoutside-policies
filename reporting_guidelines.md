# Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the #pdxcoffeeoutside Instagram account, or individually to one of the four moderators (@mrspecific, [@attackcowboy](https://www.instagram.com/attackcowboy/), @molly.sugar and @brettlovesfreya). 

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to contact, include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

* Your contact info for follow-up contact.
* Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
* Your account of what occurred. 
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an response from one of the moderators acknowledging receipt as soon as possible.

The moderators will meet to review the incident and determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* What kind of response is appropriate.


Once the team has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no code of conduct violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the moderators to the individual(s) involved.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from joining us at our Friday gatherings).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all #pdxcoffeeoutside spaces (events, instagram accounts, etc.)


Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but our response will be determined by what will be best for community safety.
